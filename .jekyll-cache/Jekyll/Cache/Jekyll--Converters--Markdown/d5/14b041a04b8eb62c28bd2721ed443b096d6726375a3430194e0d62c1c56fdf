I"B<p>Rear-ended the car in front of you? Your fault.</p>

<p>Had an argument with your spouse? Your fault.</p>

<p>Overweight or unhealthy? Your fault.</p>

<p>Angry email from a customer? Your fault.</p>

<p>Rained on the way to work? Your fault.</p>

<p>Earthquake in Japan? Your fault.</p>

<p>Even when it’s not your fault it’s still your fault.</p>

<p>Far from being doom and gloom, this is a deceptively simple mental model you can apply improve the quality of your life.</p>

<p>Taking responsibility for a negative outcome means <em>you did something wrong first time around</em>. Which means that <em>you can do something differently to affect a different outcome next time.</em></p>

<p>Assigning fault to something is the same thing as saying that thing was the <em>cause</em> of an <em>outcome</em>.</p>

<p>Cause = power to affect outcomes, good or bad</p>

<p>Take the following example for instance: “Mark misunderstood me.” Either Mark or the misunderstanding caused the negative outcome. Now that sentence might objectively be true - it could have been a simple misunderstanding, or Mark could be an asshole - but it’s a rather lazy way to approach a problem, and not a useful way to think. The problem is that whatever you assign blame to, you are also assigning power to, power to affect outcomes now <em>and</em> in the future.</p>

<p>Assigning blame to something external absolves you of the responsibility for bad things happening, but more importantly <em>robs you of</em> <em>the power to affect future outcomes</em> as well. **Mark could fail to understand you again. The trains might be delayed making you late for work. Only so many days in a row you can use that excuse before having a discussion with your boss about getting up earlier…</p>

<p>What is <em>true</em> or <em>fair</em>, is <em>irrelevant</em>. The point is to adopt a mental model that is valuable to you and to others.</p>

<p>Taking responsibility empowers you with the knowledge that you can affect future outcomes. People who know they can change the world are much more likely to try</p>
