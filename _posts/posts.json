    "body": "Rear-ended the car in front of you? Your fault.\n\nHad an argument with your spouse? Your fault.\n\nOverweight or unhealthy? Your fault.\n\nAngry email from a customer? Your fault.\n\nRained on the way to work? Your fault.\n\nEarthquake in Japan? Your fault.\n\nEven when it’s not your fault it’s still your fault.\n\nFar from being doom and gloom, this is a deceptively simple mental model you can apply improve the quality of your life.\n\nTaking responsibility for a negative outcome means *you did something wrong first time around*. Which means that *you can do something differently to affect a different outcome next time.*\n\nAssigning fault to something is the same thing as saying that thing was the *cause* of an *outcome*.\n\nCause = power to affect outcomes, good or bad\n\nTake the following example for instance: “Mark misunderstood me.” Either Mark or the misunderstanding caused the negative outcome. Now that sentence might objectively be true - it could have been a simple misunderstanding, or Mark could be an asshole - but it’s a rather lazy way to approach a problem, and not a useful way to think. The problem is that whatever you assign blame to, you are also assigning power to, power to affect outcomes now *and* in the future.\n\nAssigning blame to something external absolves you of the responsibility for bad things happening, but more importantly *robs you of* *the power to affect future outcomes* as well. **Mark could fail to understand you again. The trains might be delayed making you late for work. Only so many days in a row you can use that excuse before having a discussion with your boss about getting up earlier…\n\nWhat is *true* or *fair*, is *irrelevant*. The point is to adopt a mental model that is valuable to you and to others.\n\nTaking responsibility empowers you with the knowledge that you can affect future outcomes. People who know they can change the world are much more likely to try\n"
